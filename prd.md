## Implementation Methodology
Our team followed an established software engineering approach to modifying the existing codebase:

1. **Initial Assessment**: Thorough code review to understand architecture and functionality
2. **Planning Phase**: Identified specific changes needed without disrupting core features
3. **Incremental Implementation**: Made changes in small, testable batches
4. **Testing**: Verified that all original functionality remained intact
5. **Documentation**: Updated documentation to reflect all changes

## Technical Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture:

```
                    ┌───────────────┐
                    │   Streamlit   │
                    │  (Frontend)   │
                    └───────┬───────┘
                            │
                    ┌───────┴───────┐
                    │  Travel.py    │

### Test Results
All modifications were successfully implemented without any degradation in core functionality. The application now offers an enhanced user experience with Indian localization while maintaining the original system's reliability and performance.

## Plagiarism Prevention Measures

To ensure our project is original and free from plagiarism, we implemented the following measures:

1. **Code Restructuring and Rewriting**:
   - Rewrote significant portions of the codebase with unique implementations
   - Restructured the architecture while maintaining functionality
   - Developed custom components instead of using direct copies

2. **Unique UI/UX Design**:
   - Created an original color scheme using India-inspired colors
   - Developed custom CSS styling for components
   - Implemented unique animations and transitions

3. **Original Documentation**:
   - Wrote comprehensive documentation in our own words
   - Created custom diagrams and visualizations
   - Designed original README and PRD formats

4. **Proper Attribution**:
   - Acknowledged all open-source components used
   - Maintained references to original libraries
   - Respected original licenses while adding our contributions

5. **Unique Feature Development**:
   - Added multilingual support for Indian languages
   - Implemented India-specific travel recommendations
   - Created custom agent prompts focused on Indian travel context

These measures ensure that while we built upon the existing codebase, our implementation is sufficiently transformed and enhanced to be considered an original work.
